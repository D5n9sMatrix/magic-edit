Proof. Properties 1–4 were given previt
matrices of the same size. Then A + B = ai j + bi j , as before, so the (i, j)-entry of k(A + B) is
k(ai j + bi j ) = kai j + kbi j
But this is just the (i, j)-entry of kA + kB, and it follows that k(A + B) = kA + kB. The other Properties
can be similarly verified; the details are left to the reader.
The Properties in Theorem 2.1.1 enable us to do calculations with matrices in much the same way that
numerical calculations are carried out. To begin, Property 2 implies that the sum
(A + B) +C = A + (B +C)
is the same no matter how it is formed and so is written as A + B +C. Similarly, the sum
A + B +C + D
is independent of how it is formed; for example, it equals both (A + B) + (C + D) and A + [B + (C + D)].
Furthermore, property 1 ensures that, for example,
B + D + A +C = A + B +C + D
In other words, the order in which the matrices are added does not matter. A similar remark applies to
sums of five (or more) matrices.
Properties 5 and 6 in Theorem 2.1.1 are called distributive laws for scalar multiplication, and they
extend to sums of more than two terms. For example,
k(A + B −C) = kA + kB − kC
(k + p − m)A = kA + pA − mA
Similar observations hold for more than three summands. These facts, together with properties 7 and
8, enable us to simplify expressions by collecting like terms, expanding, and taking common factors in
exactly the same way that algebraic expressions involving variables and real numbers are manipulated.
The following example illustrates these techniques.
